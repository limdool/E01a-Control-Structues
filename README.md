This depository has several files that you will need for completing the assignment. On Cavas, you can read the instructions for the assignment. 

For this assignment, you will be using a program called Python. In Python, single-line comments will be marked with a # sign. If a comment needs more than a single line, the comment will be marked with three matching quotation marks (''' or """). When you use VS Code, the comments will appear in a different color. You can type any information there because the Python Interpreter ignores comments. 

When you start the assignment, please edit the LICENSE file. Just simply change [year] into current year and [fullname] into your full name. Also, please edit README.md to explain what you have done.

There will be questions found. Please edit questions.txt to answer them.
